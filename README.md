Tech to use: Node.js / React / Mysql or Postgres / TypeScript or JavaScript

The Task:
A very important “client” has given a brief for a new web app that they want developed along with a
very rough mockup of what they envisage. After working with them to determine their requirements
it is apparent that they want to:
1. Build a simple website that tracks the position on the page that a user clicks.
2. The user should have the ability to choose a colour they want the clicks to be tracked as.
3. The user should be able to undo previous clicks.
4. The user should be able to save their clicks so that if the page is refreshed their clicks are still
there.
5. There should be some statistics on the clicks: Namely the total number of clicks ever made &amp;
the total number of clicks made since they user opened the page.

Acceptance Criteria:
 The project should meet the “client’s” requirements. The mockup they provided is a rough
outline of the functionality they want included, rather than specifically what they want it to
look like (so have fun with it!).
 The project should be stored in version control (Git). This repository should be pushed to
either Github/GitLab/Bitbucket for us to access.
 The project should be easy for new developers to setup with README instructions (Bonus
points for Docker!).
 Feel free to use whatever build tools/libraries/etc. that are most suitable for the given
solution.
 Bonus points for functional programming approaches when implementing functionality.
 Bonus points for unit/integration tests on server/client side.
